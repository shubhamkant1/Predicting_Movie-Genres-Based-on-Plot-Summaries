# Predicting_Movie-Genres-Based-on-Plot-Summaries 1
This project explores several Machine Learning methods to predict movie genresbased on plot summaries. Naive Bayes, Word2Vec+XGBoost and RecurrentNeural Networks are used for text classiﬁcation, while K-binary transformation,rank method and probabilistic classiﬁcation with learned probability thresholdare employed for the multi-label problem involved in the genre tagging task.Experiments with more than 250,000 movies show that employing the GatedRecurrent Units (GRU) neural networks for the probabilistic classiﬁcation withlearned probability threshold approach achieves the best result on the test set. Themodel attains a Jaccard Index of 50.0%, a F-score of 0.56, and a hit rate of 80.5%
